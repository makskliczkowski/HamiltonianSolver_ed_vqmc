# Hamiltonian Solver

This is the general solver for lattice Hamiltonians. The works is in progress but currently it includes:
- ED
- ED with symmetries
- the variational Quantum Monte Carlo solver for ansatz ground state Jastrov functions

The plan for the future is to extend it to either more than 1D Hamitlonians in the case of symmetries or add symmetries to the variational ansatz potentially 
in higher dimensions and non-spin Hamiltonians.
