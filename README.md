# Hamiltonian Solver

This is the general solver for lattice Hamiltonians. The works is in progress but currently it includes:
- ED
- ED with symmetries
- the variational Quantum Monte Carlo solver for ansatz ground state Jastrov functions

The plan for the future is to extend it to either more than 1D Hamitlonians in the case of symmetries or add symmetries to the variational ansatz potentially 
in higher dimensions and non-spin Hamiltonians.

## Interacting Models

Interacting models describe systems where particles or spins interact with each other, leading to complex quantum phenomena. These models are essential for studying phase transitions, quantum entanglement, and other fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.

- **1 - Transverse Ising Model**: A fundamental model in quantum magnetism characterized by transverse magnetic fields and interactions between neighboring spins. This model exhibits a quantum phase transition driven by the strength of the transverse field.
  
- **2 - XYZ Model**: A generalization of the Heisenberg model that includes anisotropic interactions between spins in three dimensions (x, y, z directions). This model is crucial for understanding various magnetic phases and transitions.

- **3 - Heisenberg-Kitaev Model**: A hybrid model that combines the Heisenberg interaction with Kitaev's fractionalization, leading to exotic quantum phases such as spin liquids. It is particularly relevant in the context of topological order and quantum computing.

- **4 - Quantum Statistical Mechanics (QSM)**: A framework that studies the statistical properties of quantum systems, focusing on understanding thermalization, ergodicity, and the emergence of classical behavior in quantum systems.

- **5 - Rosenzweig-Porter Model**: A model that examines the effects of randomness on quantum states, often associated with the study of quantum chaos. It investigates the transition from localized to delocalized states in disordered systems.

- **6 - Ultrametric Model**: A model characterized by an ultrametric distance structure, which influences the distribution of eigenstates. This model is useful for studying complex systems with hierarchical structures.

## Quadratic Models

Quadratic models represent systems where interactions are captured by quadratic terms in the Hamiltonian. They often yield analytical solutions and provide insight into non-interacting and weakly interacting particles.

- **100 - FF Model**: A free fermion model where particles do not interact, serving as a baseline for more complex systems. It is instrumental in understanding fermionic statistics and quantum transport.

- **101 - Aubry-AndrÃ© Model**: A model that exhibits localization phenomena due to aperiodic potentials. This model is significant in studying the interplay between disorder and quantum interference.

- **102 - SYK2 Model**: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, a prototype of a quantum chaotic system, demonstrating maximal chaos and a connection to holography. It provides insights into black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.

- **103 - Anderson Model**: A model that describes the localization of electrons in a disordered medium. It is crucial for understanding electron transport in materials and the metal-insulator transition.

- **104 - Power Law Random Bandwidth Model**: A model that examines the effects of power-law distributions on quantum states. It is particularly relevant for systems with long-range interactions and critical behavior.
